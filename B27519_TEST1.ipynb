By defining methods to control access to attributes and its modification, encapsulation helps maintain data integrity and promotes modular, secure code while Data hiding refers to restricting access to the internal state of an object. It’s achieved by making variables private and only allowing access through public methods (getters and setters).\n",

The will is stored securely and can only be accessed by an authorized lawyer or family representative. If every family member could view or change it, conflicts or misuse could arise. Encapsulation works the same way the will’s details (data) are hidden inside a secure class, and only certain methods (like “read_will()”) can access it under specific conditions. This protects sensitive family information and ensures fairness when executing the will."
